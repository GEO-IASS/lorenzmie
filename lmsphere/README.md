# lmsphere

**IDL routines for modeling and fitting holographic
video microscopy images of colloidal spheres**

This is a component of **lorenzmie**.

## What it Does

* **lmfeature**: Automated analysis of normalized holographic
microscopy images of spheres.

* **lmsphere**: Computes Lorenz-Mie microscopy image of a sphere.

* **DGGdhmLMsphere**: Object that computes a Lorenz-Mie
microscopy image of a sphere.  Optionally uses GPULib for hardware
acceleration

* **lmsphereprofile**: Computes radial profile of a Lorenz-Mie
microscopy image of a sphere.

* **fitlmsphere**: Fits normalized holographic microscopy images
of spheres to predictions of Lorenz-Mie theory.

* **fitlmsphere1d**: Fits radial profile of normalized hologram
to prediction of Lorenz-Mie theory.
